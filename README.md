# No Hope - A Text-Based Console Game.
University Project - A Text-Based Console Game.

**IMPORTANT: I do not give permission to modify my code, fork the repository, or what not. This is purely on GitHub to link to my portfolio.**

##### Please be aware that there may be bugs with this game. The game has not been intensively tested!

This project is literally half-baked piece of crap, that was rushly in development during the first year of university. This has been scrapped due to taking a break in studies, therefore, the code may be offending C# programmers. **Viewer's discretion is advised!**

No Hope Console Based game has been superseded by a more fantastic piece of work; called [Into the Shadows](https://github.com/NomNom17/into-the-shadows-public).

## Uses the following libraries
+ [SpectreConsole](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console)
+ [.NET 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
